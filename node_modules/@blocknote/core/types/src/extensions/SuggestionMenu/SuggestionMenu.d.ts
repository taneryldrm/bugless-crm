/**
 * A ProseMirror plugin for suggestions, designed to make '/'-commands possible as well as mentions.
 *
 * This is basically a simplified version of TipTap's [Suggestions](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/tree/db92a9b313c5993b723c85cd30256f1d4a0b65e1/packages/suggestion) plugin.
 *
 * This version is adapted from the aforementioned version in the following ways:
 * - This version supports generic items instead of only strings (to allow for more advanced filtering for example)
 * - This version hides some unnecessary complexity from the user of the plugin.
 * - This version handles key events differently
